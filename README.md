# automating_formy

The goal of this project is to fully write automated test cases for the following website: <https://www.saucedemo.com/>.

Automating and testing this website is a followup to my last project: <https://github.com/MariusB5/automating_formy>.

The technology stack used for this project is the following:

- **Python 3.10** as the main programming language
- **unittest** as the testing framework
- **Selenium WebDriver** as the automation framework
- **chromedriver** as the main remote control interface
- **geckodriver** as the secondary remote control interface
- **Visual Studio Code** as the main integrated development environment
- **PyCharm** as the secondary integrated development environment
- **GitHub** as the version control system
- more than 5 years of software testing experience as a QA Engineer

By completing this project, I aim to expend and refine my skills as a QA Automation Engineer.

## Note

This project will be started after I finish my current project found at: <https://github.com/MariusB5/automating_formy>.
